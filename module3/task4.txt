 1. Creating Sample Tables
    We'll use two tables employees and departments

    SQL Queries to Create Tables

    CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    dept_id INT
    );

    CREATE TABLE departments (
        dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        dept_name VARCHAR(50)
    );

    Insert Data

    INSERT INTO employees (id, name, age, salary, dept_id) VALUES
    (1, 'Alice', 30, 50000, 10),
    (2, 'Bob', 35, 60000, 20),
    (3, 'Charlie', 28, 55000, 10),
    (4, 'David', 40, 70000, 30),
    (5, 'Eva', 32, 65000, 20);

    INSERT INTO departments (dept_id, dept_name) VALUES
    (10, 'HR'),
    (20, 'IT'),
    (30, 'Finance');

2. Basic SELECT Queries;-
    Retrieve All Employees
    SELECT * FROM employees;

    Retrieve Specific Columns
    SELECT name, salary FROM employees;

    Filter Employees by Age (WHERE Clause)
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age > 30;

3. JOINs with WHERE Clause:-
   INNER JOIN (Retrieve Employee & Department):-
   SELECT employees.name, employees.salary, departments.dept_name
   FROM employees
   INNER JOIN departments ON employees.dept_id = departments.dept_id;

   INNER JOIN with WHERE Clause (Find Employees in IT Department):-
   SELECT employees.name, departments.dept_name
   FROM employees
   INNER JOIN departments ON employees.dept_id = departments.dept_id
   WHERE departments.dept_name = 'IT';

4. Other Joins:-

   LEFT JOIN (Include Employees Without Departments)
    SELECT employees.name, departments.dept_name
    FROM employees
    LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.dept_id = departments.dept_id;

   RIGHT JOIN (Include Departments Without Employees)
    SELECT employees.name, departments.dept_name
    FROM employees
    RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.dept_id = departments.dept_id;

5. More Practice Queries:-
   Find Employees Above 30 Who Work in HR
    SELECT employees.name, employees.age, departments.dept_name
    FROM employees
    INNER JOIN departments ON employees.dept_id = departments.dept_id
    WHERE employees.age > 30 AND departments.dept_name = 'HR';

   Find the Average Salary of Each Department
    SELECT departments.dept_name, AVG(employees.salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM employees
    INNER JOIN departments ON employees.dept_id = departments.dept_id
    GROUP BY departments.dept_name;
