Steps used for deploying a Spring Boot App to AWS EC2 :-

Step 1: Created aws account 

Step 2: Created ec2 instance

Created an EC2 Instance ( Virtual Server)
Go to AWS Console → EC2 → Instances → Launch Instance.

Choose OS: Selected Ubuntu.

Instance Type: Use t2.micro (Free Tier eligible).

Key Pair: Created a new key pair (BlogApplication.pem) and download it. This is like the password to log in to the server.

Security Group (Firewall):

Allowed SSH (port 22) - for logging into the server.

Allowed HTTP (port 80) - for web traffic.

Allowed Custom TCP (port 8080) - Spring Boot runs here.

Allowed Custom TCP (port 5432) - Postgres server

Step 3: Connected to EC2 Server

Go to the directory where your BlogApplication.pem key file is downloaded.
chmod 400 your-key.pem (change file permissions)
ssh -i key.pem ec2-user@public-ip

Step 4:Installed Java on EC2

sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install java-17-amazon-corretto -y  (install java)
java -version (check java version)

Step 5:Installed postgres on server

Installed postgres on the server.
Open port 5432 for connection from the ec2 public ip.
Connected to postgres from ec2.

Step 6: uploaded jar file to ec2 from local

scp -i "C:/Users/Desktop/pem_files/blog.pem" target/BlogApplication-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar ubuntu@174.129.152.55:~
copy         local pem file storage                                     target file inside BlogApplication root directory       public ec2 ip

Running this command from the root directory of BlogApplication.

Step 7: Created application.propperties on server 

Created inside /home/ubuntu/blog-config/application.propperties

Step 8: Run jar file on server

java -jar /home/ubuntu/BlogApplication-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.config.location=file:/home/ubuntu/blog-config/application.properties
Runs this command on ec2 server to run the jar file.

Step 9: Test all the apis from the server.
